# 📊 SQL Data Analytics Projects

**About This Repository**
This repository contains end-to-end data analytics projects leveraging SQL to extract, transform, and derive insights from raw data. Each project demonstrates real-world problem-solving through data exploration, cleaning, and analysis—showcasing proficiency in SQL and complementary tools like Excel.

**🔍 Projects Overview**

**1. COVID-19 Data Exploration**
📌 Objective: Analyze global pandemic trends to uncover infection rates, mortality patterns, and vaccination progress.
🛠 SQL Skills Applied:

Data aggregation (GROUP BY, SUM, COUNT)

Table joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)

Window functions for rolling metrics

Conditional filtering (WHERE, CASE WHEN)
📂 Dataset: Public COVID-19 records (cases, deaths, vaccinations).

**2. 📝 SQL EDA on Superstore Dataset**
This project showcases SQL-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Superstore dataset. It includes data cleaning and analysis using SQL techniques such as type casting, common table expressions (CTEs), joins, window functions, and aggregate functions.

🔧 Data Cleaning
- Imputed missing values using CAST() and calculated quantities
- Applied CTEs and subqueries to derive and insert clean values

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Identified top 5 products by category using RANK(), PARTITION BY, and OVER()
- Calculated average profit per order and transaction value using SUM() and AVG()
- Highlighted the most profitable products using join and aggregation logic

The project demonstrates the power of SQL for cleaning, transforming, and drawing insights from raw retail data.
